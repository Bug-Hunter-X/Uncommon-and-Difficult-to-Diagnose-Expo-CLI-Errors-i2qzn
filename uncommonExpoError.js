This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to manage an Expo project. The error message might not be very informative, such as a generic 'Something went wrong' message, or it might point to a specific issue within a dependency but not offer a clear solution.  The underlying cause can vary widely and is often difficult to track down. One potential reason is that a package used in your project might have a bug, incompatibility issue with the Expo CLI, or issues caused by the Expo CLI itself needing to be updated.
